            <h2>Finding the Right Stain for Your Custom Cabinets</h2>
            <p>
              One of the most exciting parts of designing custom cabinets is choosing the finish that brings the wood to life. Stain enhances the natural grain, adds depth, and helps you create the perfect mood for your space—whether you want something warm and inviting, rich and bold, or light and airy.
            </p>
      
            <h3>A Full Spectrum of Options</h3>
            <p>
              We offer a wide range of stain colors, from timeless classics to custom blends mixed specifically for your project. Whether you’re aiming for a natural wood tone, a deep espresso, or something in between, we’ll help you find a finish that fits your vision.
            </p>
            <p>
              Prefer something unique? We can match an existing piece or create a custom tint to complement other elements in your home. Our stains can highlight the details in the grain, soften contrast, or create a smooth, consistent look—whatever suits your style.
            </p>
      
            <h3>Love the Look of Bare Wood?</h3>
            <p>
              Some of the most beautiful finishes are the simplest. A natural finish—with no added stain—lets the wood speak for itself. This option highlights the grain and color of the material, offering a clean, organic feel that works in any room.
            </p>
      
            <h3>Your Cabinets, Your Style</h3>
            <p>
              No matter your vision, we’ll help you create a look that’s personal and polished. Stains are just one more way to make your cabinets truly yours.
