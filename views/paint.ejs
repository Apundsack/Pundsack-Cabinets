            <h2>Painted Cabinets</h2>
            <p>
              Painted cabinets offer a lot of flexibility in design. You can choose any color to match your style or needs, whether you want a classic look or something more unique. Custom-painted cabinets give you the freedom to create a look that works best for your project.
            </p>
            <p>
              We can match any color from popular fan decks or color indexes to make sure your cabinets are the exact shade you're looking for.
            </p>
      
            <h3>A Range of Color Choices</h3>
            <p>
              With painted cabinets, the options are nearly endless. You can choose a color that fits your vision, whether it's something simple or bold. If you need a specific color to match other elements in your space, we can do that too.
            </p>
      
            <h3>Durability and Finish</h3>
            <p>
              Our painted finishes are smooth and even, providing a lasting look that’s easy to maintain. These cabinets are built to stand up to everyday use while still looking good over time.
            </p>
      
            <h3>Your Cabinets, Your Color</h3>
            <p>
              With painted cabinets, the choice is entirely up to you. Whether you're looking for a classic or a custom color, we’ll help you achieve the perfect look.
