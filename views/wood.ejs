      <h2>Choosing the Right Wood for Your Custom Cabinets</h2>
  <p>
    When designing your custom cabinets, one of the first choices you'll make is the type of wood. Each wood species has its own natural grain, texture, and tone—details that can help you create a space that feels truly your own.
  </p>
  <p>
    Whether you’re drawn to smooth and subtle or bold and textured, this guide offers a look at the wood types we offer so you can find the right fit for your home.
  </p>

  <h3>Alder</h3>
  <p>
    Alder has a smooth, even grain with warm, earthy undertones. Its appearance is soft and welcoming, with subtle natural markings that add character without being too bold.
  </p>

  <h3>Birch</h3>
  <p>
    Birch features a light, consistent color and a fine grain. It’s known for its clean appearance and minimal variation, making it a great option if you’re looking for a uniform look across your cabinetry.
  </p>

  <h3>Hickory</h3>
  <p>
    Hickory is known for its striking variation in grain and color, offering a mix of light and dark areas that naturally draw the eye. No two pieces look the same, which adds a unique and dynamic element to any cabinet design.
  </p>

  <h3>Walnut</h3>
  <p>
    Walnut is a rich, deep-toned wood with a smooth, flowing grain pattern. Its natural color ranges from chocolate brown to lighter shades with occasional streaks, creating a refined and elegant look.
  </p>

  <h3>Oak</h3>
  <p>
    Oak has a strong, open grain pattern and is available in a range of warm, natural tones. Its texture is easily recognizable, adding depth and visual interest to any cabinet surface.
  </p>

  <h3>Popple (Poplar)</h3>
  <p>
    Popple (also known as poplar) has a smooth texture and straight grain. Naturally light in color with some subtle mineral streaks, it's often chosen as a paint-grade wood due to its even surface.
  </p>

  <h3>Pine</h3>
  <p>
    Pine has a soft grain pattern with occasional knots that add natural variation. Its pale color makes it easy to customize, and its organic look brings warmth and texture to any space.
  </p>

  <h3>Maple</h3>
  <p>
    Maple offers a fine, consistent grain and a naturally light color. It’s versatile and clean-looking, with just enough grain to give it visual interest without overpowering the design.
